# zclcs
Programmed by Ryan Chiu.

1st. of all, this is a little tool to manage files from different directories, try to put the views together.
2nd., it could let you remove/rename/move the file in the view you pre-defined (and now could follow one path parameter).
3rd., it has no multi-thread stuff there, so, some time you need to wait for a long term action, such as copy/move/delete a big file etc..
4th., please, use it for "not that many files" situation there.

./zclcs.py will read '.conf' file by default, which contains all the paths that need to be shown.
And this '.conf' file must list the paths under '[DIRS]' like this: '0:full path name', one path a line.
If with a parameter, then it should be a full path name, like '/mnt/harddisk01'.
With "?" or "--help" to get the above info.

When getting into it, type "?" for how to operate.
