1st. of all, this is a little tool to manage files from different directories, try to put the views together.
2nd., it could let you remove/rename/move the file in the view you pre-defined.
3rd., it has no multi-thread stuff there, so, some time you need to wait for a long term action.
4th., please, use it for "not that many files" situation there.
